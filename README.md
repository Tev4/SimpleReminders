#Simple Reminders

This app allows you to create custom reminders (fixed or recurring) that trigger clickable notifications with customization options to let you decide how they will look and sound.
By default it will run on startup, minimized to tray

Here are some hidden UI interactions
- You can drag & drop reminders in the list to order them how you want
- You can also double click them to edit them instead of using the button at the bottom
- You can use the Delete key on your keyboard to delete reminders instead of using the button at the bottom
- If a FIXED reminder's due date has passed, it will be grayed out in the list
